<h2>Coursework</h2>
<p>
  Current courses that Stephanie is participating in: 
</p>
  <h3>PROG 109</h3>
    <p>Introduction to Web Development:
      <ul>
        <li>5 credit course</li>
        <li>Instructor Maricel Medina-mora</li>
        <li>This course introduces fundamental programming techniques using
          current web development software. Students design procedures and 
          write computer instructions to solve business problems, learn procedural 
          programming, develop graphical user interfaces for the web and work 
          with events and objects.</li>
        <li>I went into this course having taken HTML once almost 10 years ago, and was
          hoping that it wouldn't be too difficult to jump back in and learn what's new in 
          web development since then. I came in knowing basic HTML tags but with no experience 
          at all in CSS and Javascript, but with the materials provided I feel comfortable
          creating and modifying HTML, CSS, and JS now. I've pushed myself to try hard, abd give a 
          little bit more on Modules and Artifacts, because this is really what I want to do and 
          it's so important to me to absorb this material.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  <h3>CMST 250</h3>
    <p>Communication in a Diverse Workplace:
      <ul>
        <li>5 credit course</li>
        <li>Instructor Matt Edwards</li>
        <li>In this course, you will be learning about various communication 
          concepts that place a strong emphasis on daily workplace communication.  
          Along with sharpening your effectiveness in today's rapidly changing 
          workplace environments, you will also enhance your communication, 
          interpersonal, nonverbal and listening skills in this course.</li>
        <li>I have worked in front offices for years, and while I like to think that my 
          communication skills have been improved by that experience, it's been so eye 
          opening for me to take this class and to be able to crystallize those actions and
          tendencies into the concepts and techniques we've gone over in 
          CMST 250. I feel like now I can focus on doing consciously what I had only ever 
          been doing subconsciously in the past.</li>
      </ul>
